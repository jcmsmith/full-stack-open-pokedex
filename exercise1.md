-Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building. What are the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the language you picked? You can search for the answers by google.

-What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions? Again, you can ask google!

-Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?

The language I chose to discuss was C# because I have a bit of familiarity with it, but I know almost nothing about the finer points such as linting, testing, and building. The recommended linters for C# that I found were (besides Visual Studio itself) StyleCop and SonarLint, with SonarLint appearing to be a bit better in large part towards it being hosted on the NuGet package manager. For testing, I would have to go with NUnit, as I have some familiarity with it and it works nicely with 3rd-party tools and environments. xUnit gets an honorable mention, though, as it apparently has a unique paradigm for testing with things like dividing tests into "facts" and "theories" among other intuitive terminology. For building, there are a gamut of tools such as Cake Build, MSBuild, FinalBuilder, Nuke, and SemanticMerge. I don't really know enough about the C# ecosystem to be able to easily choose, so I would probably just go with Visual Studio's own build tools.

Some alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub for setting up a CI pipeline are Travis CI, AppVeyor, and Azure DevOps. I've heard good things about Travis, but if I were to pick one to dive deep into I'd probably pick Azure. Travis CI looks pretty nice, and is compatible with GitHub etc. but Microsoft seems to have extensive documentation on using Azure DevOps to implement custom CI/CD pipelines for any language and platform, so it could be a go-to for say integrating a C# backend with a JS frontend. It looks pretty complicated, but for a large project the setup time would probably be worth it. Azure also integrates with Jenkins and supports GitHub for VC, and has it's own testing tools and other features. So for all of those reasons, I'm leaning towards a self-hosted environment being better for C# and these tools. This way you have one ecosystem for any kind of deployment you need to do, and avoid the pitfalls such as missing features or inflexibility that you may run into with a cloud-hosted environment.
